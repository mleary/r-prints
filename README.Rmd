# r-prints

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of r-prints is to store graphics/prints I created with R.

## Organization

* Graphics are created in the `\r` folder
* Output files are stored in `\outputs` folder under the same name as the .r file.

## Future

If I create a lot of r-graphics, I might need to reorganize and output the files to multiple locations. TBD.
